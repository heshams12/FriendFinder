FriendFinder

Built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

Used Express to handle the routing. 

The compatiablity is determined by comparing the current users score array to each friend score in the friends Array in the database. The lowest difference is the match.
